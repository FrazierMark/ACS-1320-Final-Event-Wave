# Event Wave

## This a simple frontend application that allows users to search for events in their area. The app utilizes the SeatGeek API to search a specific area and then displays them to the user.

## This application was primarily built for the final project for ACS 1320, but the next goal was to practice with applying custom shaders using ThreeJS/R3F. Shaders are featured on the home screen and as the background within all routes.
